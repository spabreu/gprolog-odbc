Description: UnixODBC interface for the Contextual GNU Prolog compiler.
 GProlog-UnixODBC is a low-level GNU Prolog binding for accessing databases
 through UnixODBC.  This package is not really meant to be used directly but
 rather as a building block for higher-level language processors such as ISCO
 (package forthcoming).
